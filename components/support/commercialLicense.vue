    <h2 class="support-main-heading">When does a commercial license make sense?</h2>
    <div class="support-content">
      If paying for open-source software seems strange to
      you – that’s because it is –
      <span
        class="bold"
      >take a minute to read why we’re doing this</span>, and
      you’ll understand.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      Typically, companies get a commercial license when the open source license
      is too restrictive, like the GPL. But hapi comes with the super permissive BSD license which makes
      traditional commercial licensing unnecessary. Another reason to get a commercial license is when the free
      “community” version is lacking features or lags behind the paid “commercial” version.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      With hapi,
      <span class="bold">
        the very best, fully featured version is always free and open
        source
      </span>. If your company keeps up with the latest version of hapi, you don’t need a license. (Unless,
      of course, you also want personal, priority support for issues, advance notice of fixes, and other
      useful perks.)
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      However,
      <span class="bold">
        very few companies can afford to migrate efficiently with every
        new major release
      </span> of a core component. Your engineering
      <span class="bold">resources are finite</span>, and you’d rather spend
      them on
      <span class="bold">building better products</span> — not upgrading your supporting infrastructure.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      <span class="bold">A hapi commercial license allows you to upgrade on your own schedule</span>,
      while still running a supported, well-maintained, and secure code.
    </div>
    <h2 class="support-main-heading commercial-heading">What happens if I don't pay for a commercial license?</h2>
    <div class="support-content">
      In a word:
      <span class="bold">nothing</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      You’ll continue to have access to
      <span class="bold">
        the very best latest version
        of the framework
      </span> under the same
      <span class="bold">open source license</span>. You will be able to rely on hapi
      for your applications and take part in the community. The open source maintainers who
      make hapi the best application framework for developers all over the world will
      continue to work on it.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      <span class="bold">
        Anything that is open source now will remain open
        source
      </span> under the same exact license in the future. Support for existing hapi
      releases follows a simple schedule. Each major version remains
      <span
        class="bold"
      >
        fully supported
        and maintained
      </span> for (whichever is later):
    </div>
    <ul class="support-list">
      <li>1 year from the day of first publication of the major version, or</li>
      <li>3 months from the day of the first publication of the following major version.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="support-content bold">
      If you stay up to date with the latest version of hapi,
      your team will have the latest features, bug fixes, and access to current community-based
      support.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      When you fall behind, you’ll be gently warned with an npm deprecation
      message while your code continues to run unchanged. If you choose to stay behind, you will be
      operate under increased risk of bugs and security issues left unattended.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      But if you understand the importance of investing in the
      technology that keeps your business’ vital applications secure, organized, and intuitive…
      then consider upgrading to a commercial license.
