    <h2 class="support-main-heading">The 1, 2, 3 of commercial support</h2>
    <h4 class="support-minor-heading">1. Keep your focus on what you're building</h4>
    <div class="support-content">
      <span class="bold">Open source software never stops evolving</span>, and your team
      will always spend some time keeping up. Major releases mean new feature and improved
      functionality, but they also mean
      <span
        class="bold"
      >time away from building your product</span>. If you don’t upgrade,
      you get left behind with technical debt.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      Licensing hapi gives you the ability to kick upgrade decisions down the road until
      <span
        class="bold"
      >you</span> want
      to upgrade. That means your team can
      <span
        class="bold"
      >stay focused on the applications they’re building right now</span>, instead of spending
      precious time migrating to new versions of open source modules on their support schedule.
    </div>
    <h4 class="support-minor-heading">2. Priority support and fast response time</h4>
    <div class="support-content">
      Free support is great when you are not on a schedule and can wait for someone to find the time to help. But in a demanding
      enterprise environment when release dates are critical, you need to make sure
      <span
        class="bold"
      >your team has access to the support and resources they need</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      Every commercial license comes with priority support. Issues opened on GitHub are guaranteed a response within 2 to 3 business days.
      Plans are available with private issues, so
      <span
        class="bold"
      >your team doesn’t feel intimidated asking for help in public</span>, and 24 hours response time.
    </div>
    <h4 class="support-minor-heading">3. Advance security notifications</h4>
    <div class="support-content">
      The time it takes to react to critical security issues determines your risk and exposure. When open source software is updated, the
      details of
      <span
        class="bold"
      >potential exploits become instantly public</span> and demand a fast response. If you learn about the issue with everyone else,
      <span
        class="bold"
      >
        you give the attackers a
        head start
      </span>.
    </div>
    <div class="support-content">
      Every commercial license comes with advance notice of critical security notifications, so you’ll have the time
      needed to
      <span class="bold">mitigate the risks before they become public</span>. Some plans also include advance patches and detailed mitigation instructions
      up to 72 hours
      <span class="bold">in advance of public disclosure</span>.
