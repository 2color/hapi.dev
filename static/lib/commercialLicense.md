### 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS.

Licensor grants the Licensee and its subsidiaries a perpetual, nonexclusive license to the Covered Software under the 3-Clause BSD License (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license as follows:

> Copyright 2012-2020 Sideway Inc.
>
> Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:
>
> 1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
>
> 2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
>
> 3. Neither the name of Sideway Inc. nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

> THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY SIDEWAY INC. "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL SIDEWAY INC. BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

### 3. LICENSE TERM.

Each license term begins on the day the license fees (in accordance with <u>Schedule C</u>) are received and acknowledged by the *Licensor*, and until the period covered by the fees ends. The *Licensee* can choose to pay for one or more terms, consecutively or non-consecutively.

Terms express in months or years end on the day prior to the start day after the stated period.

For example, if the *Licensee* paid on January 15th, 2000 for a term of a month, it receives a perpetual license for any Matching Software published until February 14th, 2000. When the paid period ends, the *Licensee* may continue to use the *Covered Software* indefinitely, but not any version published after the license term ends.

### 4. ADDITIONAL SERVICES.

During the *License Term*, the *Licensee* will be entitled to receive the additional software support services listed in <u>Schedule D</u>. The services listed are only available while the agreement is in effect. Support issues initiated during the *License Term* will continue until resolution even if the term ends. Any unused services are revoked when each paid period ends as defined by the fee schedule.

For example, if a monthly term period includes opening 2 support tickets, these tickets can only be used during that month. Once the month is over, even if the *Licensee* pays for a consecutive term, the unused support tickets from the previous period expire.

### 5. REMEDY LIMITATIONS.

*Licensor's* entire liability and only remedy for breach of this agreement shall be to return to *Licensee* the license fee for the most recent paid period.

Except for damages arising from a breach of <u>Section 2</u>, *Licensee* will have no liability for any damages or for any amounts other than the fees already paid.

### 6. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

(a) <u>Complete Agreement:</u> This License Agreement together with all schedules referred to in this Agreement, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire Agreement between the parties. This Agreement supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, representations and documentation relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(b) <u>Modifications:</u> Modifications and amendments to this Agreement, including any exhibit, schedule or attachment hereto, shall be enforceable only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

(c) <u>Applicable law:</u> If any difficulties arise from the agreement above, *Licensee* and *Licensor* agree to resolve them in Santa Clara County, California, using California courts and law.
